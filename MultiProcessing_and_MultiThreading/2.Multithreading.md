## Multithreading in Python:
We would use threading to significantly increase the speed of program by running diff tasks concurrently 

```
import time

start = time.perf_counter()


def do_something(seconds):
    print(f'Sleeping {seconds} second(s)...')
    time.sleep(seconds)
    return f'Done Sleeping...{seconds}'

do_something(1) # while this sleeps, there is no cpu computation, cpu does not work for this script till sleep time is over
do_something(1)
do_something(1)

finish = time.perf_counter()


print(f'Finished in {round(finish-start, 2)} second(s)')

# output:
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Finished in 3.0 second(s)
```
All the do_something calls are synchronous and CPU remains idle during the sleep.
This is a sign that we could improvise using threading and concurrency

### CPU bound vs IO bound tasks:
CPU bound tasks are things that are crunching a lot of numbers and using the CPU; and the I/O bound tasks are things that are just waiting for input and output operations to be completed and not really using the CPU that much.
Example of IO bound task: reading/writing from the file system and other file system operations, network operations, downloading stuff online,etc

When it comes to threading , we see its benefits when our tasks are IO bound which means we are doing a lot of waiting around for input and output operations like reading data from disk or network operations.
If used in wrong case, some programs end up being slower because of thread because of the overhead of creating and destroying different threads.

### Multithreading 
Multithreading does not run the code exactly at same time, it just gives an illusion of running code at the same time.The image below illustrates the same.

### Older way of adding threading in the python code va threading module:

```
import threading
import time

start = time.perf_counter()


def do_something():
    print(f'Sleeping 1 second(s)...')
    time.sleep(1)
    print('Done Sleeping...')

# Threads creation
t1 =  threading.Thread(target = do_something)
t2 =  threading.Thread(target = do_something)

# To run the threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

finish = time.perf_counter()


print(f'Finished in {round(finish-start, 2)} second(s)')


# Output:
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Finished in 0.0 second(s) # when the threads started, the execution went to next step, (without waiting for the threads to complete execution); which is finish time calculation
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...


```

Since the threads run in parallel, the total execution time remains ~1 second instead of 2 seconds (if run sequentially).

Now what if we want the the finish time to be calculated only after both the threads are done with execution . For this we will use join method

```
import threading
import time

start = time.perf_counter()


def do_something():
    print(f'Sleeping 1 second(s)...')
    time.sleep(1)
    print('Done Sleeping...')

# Threads creation
t1 =  threading.Thread(target = do_something)
t2 =  threading.Thread(target = do_something)

# To run the threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

finish = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Finished in {round(finish-start,2)} second(s)")

# Output:
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Finished in 1.0 second(s)

```

Now instead of creating several threads manually, we will create threads in a loop


```
import threading
import time

start = time.perf_counter()


def do_something():
    print(f'Sleeping 1 second(s)...')
    time.sleep(1)
    print('Done Sleeping...')
thread_list = []
# Threads creation
for _ in range(10):
    t  = threading.Thread(target = do_something)
    thread_list.append(t)
    t.start()
    
for thread in thread_list:
    thread.join()   # we use separate loop to join because in case we started and joined the thread in one loop, it would make the threads syncronous

# the functionality of join is to make the calling thread wait until the thread on which join() was called has finished executing. It ensures that the main program (or any other thread calling join) pauses execution until the specified thread completes.So in case we start and join the thread in loop, the loop would not go to next iteration to create/start a new thread untill the prev thread is done executing

finish = time.perf_counter()

print(f"Finished in {round(finish-start,2)} second(s)")

# Output:
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1 second(s)...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Finished in 1.1 second(s)

```

### Passing argument :
```
import threading
import time

start = time.perf_counter()


def do_something(seconds):
    print(f'Sleeping {seconds} second(s)...')
    time.sleep(seconds)
    print('Done Sleeping...')
thread_list = []
# Threads creation
for _ in range(10):
    t  = threading.Thread(target = do_something,args=[1.5])
    thread_list.append(t)
    t.start()
    
for thread in thread_list:
    thread.join()



finish = time.perf_counter()

print(f"Finished in {round(finish-start,2)} second(s)")

# Output:
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Sleeping 1.5 second(s)...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Done Sleeping...
# Finished in 1.51 second(s)

```

### A brief about the join method:

#### Key Characteristics of join()
* Thread Synchronization: Ensures that threads complete their tasks before proceeding further in the calling thread.
* Blocking Call: join() blocks the calling thread until the target thread has finished.
* Timeout Option: You can specify a timeout value, allowing the calling thread to wait for a specified amount of time rather than indefinitely.

#### Syntax:
```
thread.join(timeout=None)
```
timeout (optional):
* Specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the thread to complete.
* If omitted or set to None, join() waits indefinitely until the thread finishes.

#### How join() Works
The join() method should be called after starting the thread using start().
It ensures that the main program or calling thread does not terminate until the target thread completes its task.

Using join() with Timeout
```
import threading
import time

def worker():
    print("Thread started")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulates work taking 5 seconds
    print("Thread finished")

t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
t.start()

# Wait for a maximum of 2 seconds for the thread to complete
t.join(timeout=2) # The main thread waits for 2 seconds and resumes even though the worker thread has not finished its task.

print("Main thread continues even if worker is not done")
# Output:
# Thread started
# Main thread continues even if worker is not done
# Thread finished
```
#### Use Cases for join()
* Task Completion: Ensuring all threads complete before proceeding.
* Resource Management: Avoiding conflicts when multiple threads share resources.
* Sequential Execution: Maintaining a predictable order of execution when combining threads with other tasks.

####   Points to Note

* Calling join() on a thread that has already finished has no effect.
* Avoid circular dependencies:
If Thread A calls join() on Thread B while Thread B calls join() on Thread A, it will lead to a deadlock.
* Daemon Threads:
If the thread is marked as a daemon thread (using thread.setDaemon(True)), it will terminate automatically when the main program ends, and join() will not block indefinitely.

### Latest way to create thread in python 3.2 (ThreadPoolExecutor)
ThreadPoolExecutor is an easier and more efficient way to execute threads and it also allows to easily switch over to using multiple processes instead of threads as well, depending on the problem that we are trying to solve. Its best tp use ThreadPoolExecutor with a context manager
#### Code example:
```
import concurrent.futures
import time

start = time.perf_counter()


def do_something(seconds):
    print(f'Sleeping {seconds} second(s)...')
    time.sleep(seconds)
    return 'Done Sleeping...'
    
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    f1 = executor.submit(do_something,1)
    f2 = executor.submit(do_something,1)
    f3 = executor.submit(do_something,1)
    print(f1.result())
    print(f2.result())
    print(f3.result())

finish = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Finished in {round(finish-start,2)} second(s)")
```


### Daemon Thread in Python:

A daemon thread is a background thread that runs in parallel with the main program and is terminated automatically when the main program exits. These threads are useful for background tasks that should not prevent the program from exiting.

#### 1. Characteristics of Daemon Threads
 * Runs in the Background: Daemon threads perform low-priority tasks like monitoring, logging, or background processing.
 * Terminates with Main Thread: If the main thread (or process) finishes execution, all daemon threads are forcibly terminated, regardless of their execution state.
 * No Explicit Join Needed: Unlike normal (non-daemon) threads, daemon threads do not need explicit .join() calls to complete.
##### Use Cases:
   * Logging mechanisms
   * Background cleanup tasks
   * Monitoring processes (e.g., watching for file changes)
   * Periodic tasks that don’t need to complete if the main program exits

#### 2. Creating a Daemon Thread
In Python, you can create a daemon thread using the threading module by setting the daemon attribute to True.

Example: Daemon Thread
```
import threading
import time

def daemon_task():
    while True:
        print("Daemon thread is running...")
        time.sleep(2)

# Create a daemon thread
daemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=daemon_task, daemon=True)
daemon_thread.start()

# Main thread sleeps for 5 seconds
time.sleep(5)

print("Main program exits, daemon thread will terminate now.")

```
Output(approximate):
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Main program exits, daemon thread will terminate now.

#### 3. Difference Between Daemon and Non-Daemon Threads
|Feature	|Daemon Thread	|Non-Daemon Thread|
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
|Purpose	| Background tasks	| Main application logic |
|Terminates?	| Terminates when the main thread exits |	Continues running even if the main thread exits |
|Explicit Join?	| No need to explicitly join |	Must be joined explicitly if required|
|Example Use Cases	| Logging, monitoring, background tasks	| Core program operations, computations |
