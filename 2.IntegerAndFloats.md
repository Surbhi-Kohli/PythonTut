num=3
print(type(num)) # <class 'int'>

num_float= 3.14
print(type(num)) # <class 'float'>

print(3/2) # in python3 , this gives 1.5 else  in python 2 u get 1 as output
print(3//2) # Floor division , gives output as 1
print(3**2)#  ** = raises 3 to power 2 , gives 9
print(3%2)=1

We also have built in methods like abs,round

print(abs(-2)) # 2
print(round(3.75)) # 4
print(round(3.75,1))# round it to first digit after the decimal , u get value as 3.8


num_1 = '100'
num_2 = '200'
print(num1+num2) # 100200

num_1 = int(num_1)
num_2 = int(num_2)

print(num_1 + num_2)
