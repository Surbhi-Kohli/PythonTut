Local, Enclosing, Global, Built in
```
x = 'Global x'
def test():
 y = 'local y'
 print(y)
 print(x)

test() // local y, Global x

print(y) //if we try accessing y here, we get error NameError: name 'y' is not defined 
```
```


x = 'Global x'
def test():
 x = 'local x'
 print(x)

test() // local x

print(x) //global x
```
What if u want to modify the global x's value from within the test function.
To do this , we can tell python that the x variable within the func is the global one and we want to modify it with adding 'global x'

```
x = 'Global'
def test():
 global x
 x = 'global x being updated here to local'
 print(x) //global x being updated here to local

print(x)// global x being updated here to local

```

```

def test():
 x = 'local x'
 print(x)

test() // local x

print(x) //NameError: name 'x' is not defined 

```
Mostly Global keyword is not used

```
def test(z):
 print(z) # local z

test('local z')
print(z) # Name error: name 'z' is not defined

## Built in scope
```
m=min([4,2,3,6,1])
print(m)
```
If we want to see the variables that are in built-in scope,

```
import builtins
print(dir(builtins))
```
// dir gives a list of attributes on the given object

## Understanding Python's Built-in Namespace
Built-in Namespace:

Python has a special built-in namespace, which contains a collection of built-in functions and constants that are always available. These include functions like min(), max(), len(), print(), and constants like True, False, and None.
This built-in namespace is automatically loaded when the Python interpreter starts, making all of its functions and constants directly accessible in your code.
Built-in Namespace:

This is the namespace containing the names of all built-in functions (like min(), max(), len(), etc.), exceptions (like TypeError, ValueError, etc.), and constants (like True, False, None, etc.).
It is automatically loaded and available in every Python program by default.
Built-in names can be accessed from anywhere in the code, at any time.
## Examples of Built-in Names
Here are some common names from the built-in namespace:

Functions: abs(), len(), print(), input(), max(), min(), sum(), type(), isinstance(), etc.
Exceptions: IndexError, KeyError, TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, etc.
Constants: True, False, None, NotImplemented, etc.

## Why No Import is Needed:

Since built-in functions are part of the built-in namespace, they do not need to be imported from a module. They are always in scope, which is why you can call min() or max() without any import statement.

## The __builtins__ Module:
The built-in functions and constants are actually stored in a module named __builtins__. You can view them by accessing dir(__builtins__). However, you typically don't interact with this module directly; it is managed by the interpreter to ensure these functions are always available.

##  Overriding Built-ins

You can technically override them by defining a variable or function with the same name, but this is not recommended since it can lead to confusing behavior and bugs.

```
# Overriding the built-in min function
min = 5

# Now calling min() will result in an error
try:
    print(min([1, 2, 3]))  # Raises a TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

# To use the original min function, you can delete the override
del min

print(min([1, 2, 3]))  # Correctly prints: 1

```
Another example
```
def mins()
 pass

m = mins([2,4,1,5,6])
print(m) # TypeError: min() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given

```
The reason for the failue is that python looked for global scope for min rather than the built-in scope.
Fix:
```
def my_mins()
 pass

m = mins([2,4,1,5,6])
print(m) # 1
```
## Enclosing Scope
```
def outer:
 x = 'outer x'
 def inner():
   x = 'inner x'
   print(x) # inner x
 inner()
 print(x) # outer x
outer()
 ```

```
 x = 'outer x'
 def inner():
   print(x) # outer x
 inner()
 print(x) # outer x
outer()
```
## Whatif u want to change value of outer x variable in the inner func
```
def outer:
 x = 'outer x'
 def inner():
   nonlocal x
   x= 'outer x value is changed'
   print(x) # outer x value is changed
 inner()
 print(x) # outer x value is changed
outer()

```

   ```
x= 'global x'
def outer:
 x = 'outer x'
 def inner():
   x = 'inner x'
   print(x) # inner x
 inner()
 print(x) # outer x
outer()
print(x) # global x
