### Intro:
#### unittest Library in Python
unittest is Pythonâ€™s built-in unit testing framework used to write and run automated tests for Python code. It follows the xUnit testing framework design 
(used in JUnit for Java, NUnit for .NET, etc.)
Developers often choose Pythonâ€™s unittest framework for its built-in nature, widespread familiarity, comprehensive features,seamless integration with other tools, and proven reliability. 
As part of Pythonâ€™s standard library, unittest requires no additional installations, making it easily accessible.
Unit tests promote consistency in testing practices, aiding collaboration and maintenance.
While other frameworks like Pytest and nose offer alternatives, unittest remains a popular choice for its stability and versatility.

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Structure of unittest
A unittest test case is a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase

calc.py:

```

def add(x, y):
    """Add Function"""
    return x + y


def subtract(x, y):
    """Subtract Function"""
    return x - y


def multiply(x, y):
    """Multiply Function"""
    return x * y


def divide(x, y):
    """Divide Function"""
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError('Can not divide by zero!')
    return x / y
```

test_calc.py:

```
import unittest
import calc


class TestCalc(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(calc.add(10, 5), 15) # âœ… Passes
        self.assertEqual(calc.add(-1, 1), 0) # âœ… Passes
        self.assertEqual(calc.add(-1, -1), -2) # âœ… Passes

    def test_subtract(self):
        self.assertEqual(calc.subtract(10, 5), 5) # âœ… Passes
        self.assertEqual(calc.subtract(-1, 1), -2) # âœ… Passes
        self.assertEqual(calc.subtract(-1, -1), 0) # âœ… Passes

    def test_multiply(self):
        self.assertEqual(calc.multiply(10, 5), 50)
        self.assertEqual(calc.multiply(-1, 1), -1)
        self.assertEqual(calc.multiply(-1, -1), 1)

    def test_divide(self):
        self.assertEqual(calc.divide(10, 5), 2)
        self.assertEqual(calc.divide(-1, 1), -1)
        self.assertEqual(calc.divide(-1, -1), 1)
        self.assertEqual(calc.divide(5, 2), 2.5)

        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            calc.divide(10, 0)

# Run tests when script is executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

#### ***In ```if __name__ == "__main__":
      unittest.main()```
    what is unittest.main and how does it execute the code in my test file***
It is a command-line program that loads a set of tests from module and runs them; this is primarily for making test modules conveniently executable. The simplest use for this function is to include the following line at the end of a test script:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
You can run tests with more detailed information by passing in the verbosity argument:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)
```
 unittest.main() is a function provided by Python's built-in unittest module. It serves as the entry point for running test cases in your test script. When executed, it discovers and runs all test methods defined in the test file.   

 #### How Does unittest.main() Work?
When you include:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
it does the following:

 1. Detects Test Cases
    * It scans the test file for classes that inherit from unittest.TestCase.
    * It finds all methods in those classes that start with test_.
 2. Runs the Tests
    * Each test method is executed.
    * setUp() and tearDown() (if defined) are called before and after each test.
    * The results (pass, fail, or error) are collected.
 3.Displays the Results
   * The test output is printed to the console in a summary format.
